# Pandemos Telemedicine: A Cost-of-Care Consultant

## Overview
Pandemos, is a telemedicine platform that will be deployed as a web application to help patients schedule virtual appointments in their trusted hospitals. The platform will provide a patient-friendly cost-of-care dashboard, where patients can get better cost estimates for medical procedures from nearby hospitals. The users can compare hospitals based on the ratings & previous patients’ experiences to get a better idea about the hospital services. The dashboard is a modern analytical tool to monitor hospital Key Performance Indicators (KPI) dynamically and interactively. It can interpret machine-readable data to provide meaningful insights in the form of visual representations. Comparative analysis between hospitals based on the ratings, previous patient experiences, and treatment facilities helps users make a wise selection of their hospital. 
Once a patient registers to the platform, they will have the opportunity to create or share their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs can be leveraged and scaled to improve clinical care and health decisions. The application will incorporate a consultant management system which will assist in providing appointments with the physicians for a virtual consultation. It will also handle the sharing of EHR with an appointed physician while ensuring data democratization. Virtual consultation can be the required multi-prolonged solution to help patients, primarily symptomatic patients, communicate with physicians without physical presence.


## Challenges 🗡
- The cost-of-care associated with various healthcare providers is less understood in mixed health systems like India
- Out of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) per episode of outpatient care in public and private providers do not provide a fair comparison
- Clinical Data is generally available in machine-readable format (XML and CSV), but these formats can't be used by a patient who is comparing the prices
- Covid-19 has showed that a multipronged approach is the need of the hour that can prevent long term health consequences

## Solution 📃
- Dashboard can interpret machine readable data to provide meaningful insights in the form of visual representations
- Cost-of-Care dashboard can deliver comparative analysis between healthcare service providers (HSPs), and improve patient decision making
- Electronic health records (EHR) can be leveraged and scaled to improve clinical care and health decisions
- openEHR is a free-to-use EHR standard that reduces the workload of building HIPAA compliant EHR templates
- Virtual consultation can be the required multi-pronged solution that can help patients, especially symptomatic patient to communicate with physician without the need of physical presence
